# DWD Carbon - Pebble Weather Watchface

A fork of [Carbon](https://github.com/cr0ybot/carbon) — a weather-focused, highly readable-at-a-glance Pebble watchface for the day ahead. This fork defaults to the [DWD](https://www.dwd.de) (Deutscher Wetterdienst) weather source via [Bright Sky](https://brightsky.dev), best for locations in/around Germany, with the free [Open-Meteo](https://open-meteo.com) API (worldwide coverage) still available as an option.

There are several other weather-focused Pebble watchfaces that might look similar, but I found most of those *too* maximal for my needs (forecast for more than 24 hours, too visually busy, etc.). I wanted something focused just on the things that are most relevant to me over the next 24-hour period that I can grok at a glance.

## Features

- The current time, of course, with a large, high-contrast font.
- The current date and day of week in the system locale's language.
- The current location and timezone.
- Current temperature, shown below the weather condition icon.
- 24-hour temperature graph with secondary apparent temperature line, with the min/max for that 24-hour window shown to its left.
- 24-hour precipitation probability graph with cloud cover.
- Daylight indicator with sunrise and sunset times.
- Moon phase on the midnight indicator.
- Current weather condition icon.
- Battery level and charging status, shown in red when critically low (below 15%, on color platforms).
- Bluetooth disconnect indicator.
- Respects system 12/24-hour time format.
- Temperature unit detection based on locale (defaults to Celsius, but Fahrenheit if you're in the US).

## Settings

- Temperature unit: Auto (default), Celsius, or Fahrenheit
- Weather source: DWD (default, Deutscher Wetterdienst via Bright Sky — best coverage in/around Germany) or Open-Meteo (worldwide coverage)
- Date format: "Monday, 1/15" default, several other presets (please open an issue if your preferred date format isn't available)
- Battery indicator: Icon (default), Percentage, or Off
- Show Timezone: On (default) or Off
- Show AM/PM / 24h Indicator: On (default) or Off

| 24h indicator off | Timezone off | Battery critically low |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ![24h/AM-PM indicator disabled](./info/screenshots.settings-24h-off.emery.png) | ![Timezone indicator disabled](./info/screenshots.settings-timezone-off.emery.png) | ![Battery icon shown in red below 15%](./info/screenshots.settings-battery-low.emery.png) |

## Reporting Issues

You may choose to report an issue either through the "contact developer" link in the Pebble app store or by opening a new issue on the project's GitHub repository.

If you're experiencing unexpected behavior, the **Debug** section at the bottom of the settings page can help identify the cause and gives us a snapshot of everything the watchface knows at that moment. Ideally, bug reports should include this debug information to assist in troubleshooting.

To access it:
1. Open the Pebble app and tap the gear icon next to DWD Carbon to open settings.
2. Scroll to the bottom of the settings page and expand the **Debug** section.
3. Review the data inline, or tap **Copy debug info to clipboard** to grab it all as JSON.

The clipboard JSON contains everything displayed in the **Debug** section, including:
- `activeWatchInfo` — watch hardware, platform, and firmware version
- `buildInfo` — build metadata including version, git commit hash, branch, dirty flag, and build date
- `cache` — the full weather payload including fetch time, expiry, and all hourly data
- `settings` — current Clay settings stored on the phone
- `eventLog` — log of recent communication and fetch events

> **Before sharing debug info in a GitHub issue, obfuscate the `lat` and `lon` values** inside `cache.payload` and anything else you deem sensitive to protect your location privacy.

## Development

> AI agents working in this repo: see [AGENTS.md](./AGENTS.md) first.

### Prerequisites

- [Pebble SDK](https://developer.repebble.com/sdk/) (includes the `pebble` CLI tool)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) (for PKJS dependencies)

### Code completion

For code completion and linting, you can use [clangd](https://clangd.llvm.org/) with the `compile_commands.json` generated by the Waf build system. To get the most out of it, you'll want to have clangd 22+ for better docblock support. I had to install llvm via Homebrew and add it to my PATH to get a new enough version of clangd on MacOS.

### Build & run in emulator

Build the watchface using the Pebble CLI:

```sh
pebble build
```

Then install it on the emulator of your choice:

```sh
# Pebble Time 2 (rectangular, 200×228)
pebble install --emulator emery --logs

# Pebble 2 Duo (rectangular, 144×168)
pebble install --emulator flint --logs
```

Note that adding/removing `messageKeys` in package.json will require a `pebble clean` before the next build to avoid stale generated code.

#### Emulator config page

To test the config page with the emulator:

```sh
pebble emu-app-config
```

### Install on your device

See [AGENTS.md](./AGENTS.md#install-on-a-real-device) for installing on a
real device via `pebble login` / `--cloudpebble`.

### Demo Build & Screenshots

See [AGENTS.md](./AGENTS.md#demo-builds--screenshots) for demo builds and
screenshot commands.

### Project Structure

See [AGENTS.md](./AGENTS.md#repository-layout) for the repository layout.

### Debug Info

The settings page includes a **Debug** section (collapsed by default) powered by the `debug-info` custom Clay component in `src/pkjs/config/debug.js`. It reads the weather cache and current Clay settings from `localStorage` at the moment the settings page is opened, merges in the active watch info from the Clay runtime, and renders each key as a collapsible `<details>` block.

Build metadata is written to `.buildinfo.json` (gitignored) at the start of every `pebble build` and bundled into the JS. It contains:

```json
{
  "version": "1.4.0",
  "hash": "abc1234",
  "branch": "main",
  "dirty": false,
  "buildDate": "2026-07-03T15:00:00+00:00"
}
```

To add new fields to the debug output, add keys to the object returned by `formatDebugInfo()` in `src/pkjs/index.js`. The component renders any key it receives without needing changes.

### Icons

This watchface uses icons from the [Carbon](https://carbondesignsystem.com/elements/icons/library/) icon set, which has the most exhaustive set of weather icons available. The name is a coincidence — the original watchface (which this is forked from) was named Carbon before the icon set was found.

See [AGENTS.md](./AGENTS.md#icons) for the icon editing/regeneration workflow.
